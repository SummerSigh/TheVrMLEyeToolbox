## mEYE 

**A re implementaion of https://github.com/fabiocarrara/meye**

***What is mEYE***

mEYE is a small uNET model desinged for pupil segmentation and blink estemation. 

***Why use mEYE?**

Currently, it's not only great at predicting where the pupil is, but also if the use has blinked or not. On top of that, it allows for automatic ROI croping of the pupil 
so that other methods such as RANSAC have an easier time in finding the pupil.
